# TSH Test Data Conversion Assignment
This is the submission for TSH assignment.

## Use of the codes
Please put the `test_data.txt` file in the same folder with `zl187_TSH_test_data_conversion.py`. Use `Python supported editor` to open `zl187_TSH_test_data_conversion.py` and run it. 10 `.json` files containing information of 10 patients will be generated based on the `test_data.txt` file. And the contents in each `.json` file would also be printed out.

* The `.json` file generated are named in the format of `firstname-lastname.json`.

## Components of the module
There are 8 functions including `main_code()` and a `class` definition in the `zl187_TSH_test_data_conversion.py` module. The documentation has been created with Sphinx and uploaded in the folder `html`. You may refer to it as needed.

* When opening `index.html`, you would see the welcome page

## Branches and files
### Branches
Following the timeline, all branches are listed below:

* `zl187/add-diagnosis` - This branch is used to push the first version of the codes from reading in data to diagnosis. It hasn't been merged into the `master` branch, because I edited the codes soon after and pushed the new codes to github with files initializing travisCI and test files in `zl187/init-travisCI` branch.

* `zl187/init-travisCI` - This branch is used to push new codes, test files and the files initializing travisCI.

* `zl187/add-create-json` - This branch is used to add the new parts of the codes creating and printing out the contents in `.json` files.

* `zl187/add-TSH-sorted` - This branch is used to add the part for sorting TSH results to do the first bonus.

* `zl187/add-docstring` - This branch is used to add docstring for the codes in google style.

* `zl187/add-sphinx` - This branch is used to upload the `html` files generated by Sphinx containing the documentation.

* `zl187/upload-json-files` - This branch is used to upload all the `.json` files generated after running `zl187_TSH_test_data_conversion.py`.

* `zl187/update-README` - This branch is used to update the README.md.

### Files
There are a lot of files uploaded this time. And they are either in folder or out of folder.
#### Out of folder

* `.travis.yml` and `requirements.txt` are used for initializing travisCI.

* `test_zl187_TSH_test_data_conversion.py` is the file used for testing the function `diagnosis()`. It has been renamed from test_diagnosis after I read the commits of last assignment.
